## What is Advent Of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a coding advent calendar

## Ok, and what is this?
These are my solutions, in pure C

## How do I run this?
Each program needs 2 files
dayn_test.txt and dayn.txt
(\_test is for the first few example values)
If you're on windows you can do `./run dayn` (where n is the day) or `./run all`, if you're on linux you can inspect run.bat and translate it to bash I guess lol
